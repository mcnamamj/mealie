You can use bookmarklets to generate a desktop browser bookmark that takes your current tab's URL and sends it to Mealie as a new recipe.

To create the bookmarklet configured for your installation and group:

0. Log into your Mealie instance
1. Click the Create button on the side nav and choose Import
2. On the right side of the page, switch "Import with URL" to "Create Bookmarklet"
3. Choose your options
4. Select and copy all the javascript text to your clipboard
5. Create a new Bookmark in your browser, and paste the javascript into the URL/Address of the bookmark
